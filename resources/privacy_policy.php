</p>
<h3>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS
        YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
<p>
<i><b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary
and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like
with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or
fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate
business interests.</i>
<i><b><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></b></i><br/>
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain
the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As
such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:<br/>
<ul>
        <li><b>Consent.</b>We may process your information if you have given us permission
                (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can
                withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your
                consent.</li>
        <li><b>Performance of a Contract.</b>We may process your personal information when
                we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including
                providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with
                you.</li>
        <li><b>Legal Obligations.</b>We may process your information where we believe it is
                necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with
                a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
                involved.</li>
                <li><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is
                        necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party,
                        such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
         
</ul><br/>
<i><b><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></b></i>
We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e.,
express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in
situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You
can withdraw your consent at any time.
In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to
process your information without your consent, including, for example:<br/>
<ul>
        <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
                obtained in a timely way</li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
        <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to
                assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next
                of kin</li>
        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be
                victim of financial abuse</li>
        <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise
                the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is
                reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a
                contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or
                rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
        <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business,
                or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the
                information was produced</li>
        <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
        <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
</ul>

<ul>

        <li><b>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</b>We may share your information
                with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING
        TECHNOLOGIES?</h3>
<p>       
<i><b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store
your information.</i><br/>
We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels)
to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such
technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.
</p>
<h3>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>
<p>
<i><b>In Short:</b> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media
account, we may have access to certain information about you.</i><br/>
Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do
this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media
provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and
profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
social media platform.<br/>
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.
Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your
personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that
you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites
and apps.
</p>
<h3>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
<p>
<i><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</i><br/>
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or
permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose
in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
period of time in which users have an account with us.<br/>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not
possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
any further processing until deletion is possible.
</p>
<h3>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
<p>
<i><b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
organizational and technical security measures.</i><br/>
We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
Services within a secure environment.<br/>
</p>
<h3>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>
<p>
<i><b>In Short:</b> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</i><br/>
We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By
using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent
or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the
Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age
has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to
promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
panna07@gmail.com.
</p>
<h3>10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
<p>
<i><b>In Short:</b> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</i><br/>
In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain
rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv)
if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decisionmaking. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting
us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT
US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.<br/>
We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data
protection laws.<br/>
If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing
your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State
data protection authority or UK data protection authority.<br/>
If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and
Information Commissioner.<br/>
<b><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u></b> If we are relying on your consent to process your
personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can
withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details
provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"
below or updating your preferences.<br/>
However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your
personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
consent.<br/>
<b><u>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</u></b> You can unsubscribe
from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the
unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details
provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"
below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still
communicate with you â€” for example, to send you service-related messages that are
necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service
requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Account Information</b><br/>
If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
terminate your account, you can:
<ul>
        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
</ul>
Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your
account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some
information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
requirements.<br/>
<b><u>Cookies and similar technologies:</u></b> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies
by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove
cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this
could affect certain features or services of our Services.<br/>
If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
panna07@gmail.com.
</p>
<h3>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
<p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your
privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
version of this privacy notice.
</p>

<u>Verification process</u><br/>
Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are
the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These
verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it
with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the
type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we
can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file,
or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that
you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as
the circumstances dictate.<br/>
We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting
additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request
that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and
for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
information as soon as we finish verifying you.<br/>
