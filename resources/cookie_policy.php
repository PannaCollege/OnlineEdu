        <h3>COOKIE POLICY</h3>
        <h5>Last updated January 22, 2024</h5>
        <p>
            This Cookie Policy explains how pannacollege ("Company," "we," "us," and "our")
            uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at
            https://pannacollege.org ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and
            why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
            In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes
            personal information if we combine it with other information.
        </p>
        <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
        <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when
            you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their
            websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, pannacollege) are called "first-party
            cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party
            cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
            provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
            analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer
            both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other
            websites.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
        <p>
            We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required
            for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as
            "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and
            target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties.
            Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other
            purposes. This is described in more detail below.
        </p>
        <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
        <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise
            your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The
            Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you
            accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary
            to provide you with services.
            The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our
            website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your
            access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may
            also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
            The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and
            the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the
            specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you

    <h3>How can I control cookies on my browser?</h3>
    <p>     
As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls
vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more
information. The following is information about how to manage cookies on the most
popular browsers:
<ul>
    <li>Chrome</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer</li>
    <li>Firefox</li>
    <li>Safari</li>
    <li>Edge</li>
    <li>Opera</li>
</ul>
In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted
advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit:
<ul>
    <li>Digital Advertising Alliance</li>
    <li>Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</li>

</ul>
    </p>
    <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web
        beacons?</h3>
    <p>
Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use
other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called
"tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our Website or
opened an email including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic
patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or
communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website
from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many
instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so
declining cookies will impair their functioning.
    </p>
    <h3>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h3>
    <p>
Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared
Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your
use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other site operations.
If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the
settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools
contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies
by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which
may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash
Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash
LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the
operator of the page you are on at the time).
Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash
Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications,
including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or
online content.
    </p>
    <h3>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h3>
    <p>
Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve
advertising through our Website. These companies may use information about your
visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about
goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology
that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. They can accomplish
this by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this
and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services
of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not
enable us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that directly
identify you unless you choose to provide these.
    </p>
    <h3>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h3>
    <p>
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example,
changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of
cookies and related technologies.
The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.
